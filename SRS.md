| **Execution** | `/api/chat` route, prompt.ts |
| **Acceptance** | Live Context Block refreshed each turn, no stale data; prompt <2000 tokens |

| FR-6.2 | Live Context Block |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Injected every turn: current balances, this-month spend vs. last-3-mo avg, top 3 categories, risk breakdown, active anomalies, savings goals. Timestamp shows "generated HH:MM:SS". |
| **Execution** | `buildLiveContextBlock(userId)` in prompt.ts; called at route handler start |
| **Acceptance** | All numbers match DB query results within ±1 PKR; block appears early in system prompt |

| FR-6.4 | Tool Calling Loop |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Vercel AI SDK `streamText` with `maxSteps=6` (max 6 tool calls per turn), `temperature=0.3`. LLM picks tools, tools execute server-side, results stream back. |
| **Execution** | `/api/chat` route handler |
| **Acceptance** | Multi-step reasoning works ("call X, then based on result call Y"); max steps prevents infinite loops |

| FR-6.5 | Output Validator |
|---|---|
| **Description** | After LLM synthesizes final answer, regex extracts every `PKR \d[\d,]*` and `\d+%` occurrence. Verify each matches (within ±1 PKR or ±0.5%) a number in tool results or Live Context Block. If mismatch found, either strip the sentence or append note "(verified by financial rule engine)". |
| **Execution** | `validator.ts`, called before response shipped to client |
| **Acceptance** | No fabricated PKR figures reach user; validator passes >95% of correct answers, flags edge cases for inspection |

| FR-6.6 | Tool Result Framing |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Each tool result includes `{data: {...}, meta: {source: "getRiskScore(...)", timestamp}}`. LLM instructed to cite source. |

|---|---|
| **Description** | One-time precompute: for each Transaction, embed text `"{merchant} | {category} | {description} | PKR {amount} | {date}"` via Transformers.js (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). Store as Bytes (Uint8Array) in Transaction.embedding DB column. |
| **Execution** | `scripts/embed_all.ts` runs once after seed; hot-reloadable for re-embeddings |
| **Acceptance** | All 128 transactions have embeddings; embedding loads model on first call (<5s), subsequent calls <10ms |

| FR-7.2 | Query Embedding & Top-K Retrieval |
|---|---|
| **Description** | On `retrieveSimilarTransactions(query, k=5)` call: embed query text via same model, decode all transaction embeddings from DB, compute cosine similarity (in-memory), rank top-k. Apply recency boost: boost score by 0.05 if transaction within last 14 days. |
| **Execution** | `rag/retrieve.ts` module; called by tool handler |
| **Acceptance** | Top-1 result has semantic relevance to query (validated manually for seed data); latency <100ms for 128 txs |

| FR-7.3 | Embedding Cache |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Cache decoded embeddings in-memory per user; invalidate cache after 60s or on manual trigger (e.g., after new transaction added) |
| **Execution** | `rag/store.ts` in-memory Map per userId |

**Actor:** User asks "What will I spend next month?"  
**Goal:** Return next-month spending projection per category with confidence band

**Functional Requirements:**

| FR-8.1 | EWMA + Linear Trend Blend |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Per category: take 3 monthly totals (m1, m2, m3 = oldest → newest). Compute EWMA(α=0.5) = 0.25×m1 + 0.25×m2 + 0.5×m3. Compute linear regression slope over (0,m1), (1,m2), (2,m3). Blend = 0.6×ewma + 0.4×(ewma + trend). Return {blend, low=blend-σ, high=blend+σ}. |
| **Execution** | `forecast/engine.ts` module |
| **Acceptance** | Blend result is weighted sum; trend captures 3-month direction; bounds are ±1 std dev; formula matches architecture doc §7.2 |

| FR-8.2 | Honest Limits |
|---|---|
| **Description** | System prompt tells user: "Forecast uses 3 monthly observations and simple EWMA+trend. Not suitable for >3 months ahead; no seasonality detection (need ≥12 months); take as rough estimate ±20%." |
| **Execution** | Hardcoded disclaimer in Live Context Block or forecast tool result explanation |
| **Acceptance** | User sees limitation statement on Forecast page; viva committee appreciates honesty |

| FR-8.3 | Monthly Aggregation |
|---|---|

Weight: 0.35 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.15 + 0.10 = 1.0. Final score = 100 × weighted sum. Band: low ≤30, moderate 30–60, high >60. |
| **Execution** | `finance/rules.ts::riskScore()` |
| **Acceptance** | Score ∈ [0, 100]; breakdown sums to final score; band matches score; all inputs are deterministic queries |

| FR-9.2 | Affordability Check |
|---|---|
| **Description** | For a purchase of amount X now: check if (savingsBalance + checkingBalance - 3×monthlyExpenses_emergency_buffer) ≥ X. For future months ahead N: project (savingsBalance + N×avgMonthlySavings + checkingBalance - buffer) ≥ X. Return {canAfford, available, shortfall, monthsNeeded}. |
| **Execution** | `finance/rules.ts::affordability()` |
| **Acceptance** | Respects emergency buffer; projects savings linearly; edge case: monthsNeeded capped at 60 |

| FR-9.3 | Installment EMI Safety |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Monthly EMI = (price × (1 + apr/12)) / months (simplified; real formula is more complex, but MVP uses this). Check if EMI ≤ 0.30 × (monthlyIncome - essentialMonthlyExpenses). Return {monthly, ratio, safe, reason}. |
| **Execution** | `finance/rules.ts::installmentSafety()` |
| **Acceptance** | EMI calc matches financial formula; ratio respects 30% threshold; reason explains "safe" or why it failed |

| FR-9.4 | Monthly Health |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Current month: sum MTD spend. Project month-end via run-rate. Compare vs. 3-month average baseline. Return status: "on_track" if projected <100%, "watch_out" if 100–110%, "overspending" if >110%. Include reason explaining the pace. |
| **Execution** | `finance/rules.ts::monthlyHealth()` |
| **Acceptance** | Projected month-end matches run-rate formula; band boundaries are defensible |

| FR-9.5 | Savings Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Description** | Target savings rate = 20% of income (or higher if emergency buffer not met). Recommended monthly transfer = max(0, 0.2×income - (income - essential - buffer)). Return amount + reasoning. |
| **Execution** | `finance/rules.ts::savingsRecommendation()` |
| **Acceptance** | Respects 20% guideline; accounts for emergency buffer; tone is advisory |

| FR-9.6 | Goal Completion Projection |
|---|---|
| **Description** | For each SavingsGoal: current_amt, target_amt, projected_daily_savings (from history). Months to target = (target - current) / (daily_avg × 30). Return goal name, progress %, projected completion date. |
| **Execution** | `finance/rules.ts::goalProgress()` |
| **Acceptance** | Projection is linear extrapolation; capped at 60 months; completion date is realistic if savings rate holds |

| **Rationale** | Prevents LLM timeout (Groq timeout ~60s, but streaming stalls if tools slow) |

| NFR-4.4 | RAG Retrieval |
|---|---|
| **Target** | retrieveSimilarTransactions(query, k=5): <100ms (cache hit) or <500ms (cold) |
| **Measurement** | Tool result includes execution time |
| **Rationale** | User doesn't notice <100ms; cold start acceptable once per 60s |

| NFR-4.5 | Bundle Size |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Client-side JS + CSS: <300KB (gzipped) |
| **Measurement** | `next build`, `ls -lh .next/static/` |
| **Rationale** | Fast first paint on slow networks (viva WiFi) |

### 4.2 Reliability & Availability

| NFR-4.6 | Uptime (Local Dev) |
|---|---|
| **Target** | 99.9% (no unplanned downtime during viva) |
| **Measurement** | Manual checks before demo |
| **Rationale** | Viva is a one-shot event; failure = catastrophic |

| NFR-4.7 | Error Recovery |
|---|---|
| **Target** | On Groq outage / network failure: user sees "Temporarily unavailable. Try again in a few seconds." with retry button (no crash) |
| **Measurement** | Simulate network error, verify UI graceful |
| **Rationale** | Professional appearance; prevents user panic |

| NFR-4.8 | Data Durability |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Seeded data persists across server restarts (SQLite on disk) |
| **Measurement** | `npm run dev`, seed, kill server, `npm run dev` again, verify data intact |
| **Rationale** | No surprise data loss |

### 4.3 Scalability (Aspirational)

| NFR-4.9 | Single-User MVP |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Hardcoded userId=1; no multi-user support in MVP |
| **Measurement** | Code review: `DEMO_USER_ID = 1` constant appears in all queries |
| **Rationale** | Saves 2 hours of auth/RLS scaffolding for viva-ready MVP |

| NFR-4.10 | Future Multi-User Path |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Schema prepared for multi-user (User, UserProfile, Account FK userId). Auth scaffolded (NextAuth routes exist but not wired). |
| **Measurement** | `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` exists (stub); prisma schema has userId FK everywhere |
| **Rationale** | Architecture debt minimized; upgrade path clear for post-semester |

### 4.4 Security

| NFR-4.11 | API Key Protection |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Groq API key stored ONLY in `.env.local` (never committed, never logged, never exposed to client) |
| **Measurement** | `.gitignore` includes `.env*`; API key never in error messages shown to user |
| **Rationale** | Prevent API quota abuse, protect user data indirectly |

| NFR-4.12 | Input Validation |
|---|---|
| **Target** | All user inputs (chat message, affordability price, etc.) validated via Zod schemas before processing |
| **Measurement** | Zod parse() called on every form submission / API POST |
| **Rationale** | Prevent injection, type errors, invalid state |

| NFR-4.13 | PII Handling |
|---|---|
| **Target** | No full names, account numbers, or sensitive details logged or displayed in chat. User profile kept server-side. |
| **Measurement** | Code review: no `console.log(userProfile)` or PII in error messages |
| **Rationale** | Privacy; viva evaluator doesn't see real financial data even if they inspect browser |

| NFR-4.14 | Output Validation |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Every PKR figure in chatbot answer verified against source before delivery. Fabricated numbers stripped or flagged. |
| **Measurement** | Validator catches 100% of hallucinations in test suite |
| **Rationale** | Core anti-hallucination layer; demonstrates NLP rigor |

| NFR-4.15 | Prompt Injection Defense |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Transaction descriptions (untrusted user content) wrapped in `[USER_TX_DATA]…[/USER_TX_DATA]` blocks in tool results. System prompt forbids following instructions from inside these blocks. |
| **Measurement** | Attempt to inject prompt in transaction description; verify LLM ignores it |
| **Rationale** | Prevent jailbreak via malicious merchant names / descriptions |

### 4.5 Maintainability & Code Quality

| NFR-4.16 | TypeScript Strict Mode |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Zero type errors; `npx tsc --noEmit` passes |
| **Measurement** | CI check (manual before demo) |
| **Rationale** | Confidence; reduces runtime bugs |

| NFR-4.17 | Code Organization |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Clear separation: lib/finance (rules), lib/rag (embeddings), lib/chat (orchestration), lib/forecast (projections). Each module ≤500 LOC, single responsibility. |
| **Measurement** | File sizes; `wc -l src/**/*.ts` |
| **Rationale** | Viva examiner can follow code; easy to patch bugs |

| NFR-4.18 | Documentation |
|---|---|
| **Target** | README.md with setup, demo script, architecture paragraph, tech stack. Comments in code for non-obvious logic (e.g., EWMA formula, risk weighting). No multi-paragraph docstrings; only 1-liners. |
| **Measurement** | README exists; architecture doc linked; key functions have one-line explanations |
| **Rationale** | Viva readiness; future maintainability |

### 4.6 Usability

| NFR-4.19 | Responsive Design |
|---|---|
| **Target** | All pages render correctly on desktop (≥1024px width). Tailwind CSS grid/flex adapt. Mobile (≤768px) is optional. |
| **Measurement** | Visual inspection on laptop + tablet screen sizes |
| **Rationale** | Viva typically on 13"–15" laptops; no surprise layout breaks |

| NFR-4.20 | Accessibility (Optional) |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Basic semantic HTML: buttons are `<button>`, inputs are `<input>`, tables are `<table>`. Color contrast >4.5:1 for text. |
| **Measurement** | Lighthouse accessibility audit ≥80 |
| **Rationale** | Professional appearance; inclusive (not required for viva but helps) |

| NFR-4.21 | Error Messages |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Error messages are user-friendly, actionable: not "500 Internal Server Error" but "Chat temporarily unavailable. Please try again." or "Please enter a valid amount (0–10,000,000 PKR)." |
| **Measurement** | Manual testing of error paths (bad API key, network failure, invalid input) |
| **Rationale** | User confidence; professionalism |

## 5. Data Requirements

### 5.1 Data Model

**Entities:**
- **User** (1 per demo; hardcoded id=1): email, name, createdAt
- **UserProfile** (1:1 User): monthlyIncome, riskTolerance, dependents, notesAboutSelf
- **Account** (N per User): name (Checking, Savings, Cash), type, balance
- **Category** (14 hardcoded): name (unique), parent enum, isEssential flag
- **Transaction** (128 per demo): userId, accountId, categoryId, date, amount (signed int), type, merchant, description, isAnomaly, embedding (Bytes for RAG)
- **SavingsGoal** (N per User): name, targetAmount, targetDate, currentAmount
- **Conversation** (1 per chat session): userId, startedAt
- **Message** (N per Conversation): role, content, toolCalls (JSON), toolResults (JSON), createdAt

### 5.2 Data Integrity Constraints

| Constraint | Enforcement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Transaction.amount is signed integer (PKR) | TypeScript type + Prisma validation | Avoid floating-point rounding; expenses are negative, income positive |
| Transaction.amount ∈ [-10,000,000, 10,000,000] | Zod parse + DB check | Catches typos (e.g., 10 million instead of 10k) |
| Transaction.date ≤ today | Seed validation + form validation | No future-dated transactions (except forecast) |
| User.email is unique | Prisma unique constraint | One account per email (even though only 1 user in MVP) |
| Category.name is unique | Prisma unique constraint | No duplicate categories |
| Sum of 3-month expenses ∈ [200k, 300k] | Seed assert | Data realism gate |

### 5.3 Data Access Patterns

| Pattern | Frequency | Latency Budget | Optimization |
|---|---|---|---|
| Load last 10 messages | Per chat turn | <100ms | Index (conversationId, createdAt DESC); pagination limit 10 |
| Sum spending by category (this month) | Dashboard + chat | <100ms | Prisma groupBy(categoryId); Prisma caches locally |
| Sum spending by month (3 months) | Forecast + chat | <100ms | Separate query, group by year-month; small result set |
| Decode + cosine all embeddings | Chat (rare) | <500ms cold, <100ms hot | In-memory cache per user, 60s TTL |
| Load transaction details (pagination) | Transactions page | <200ms | Index (userId, date DESC); fetch 20 per page |

### 5.4 Data Retention & Backups

| Category | Retention | Backup |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic seed data | Session-lifetime; regenerable via `npm run seed` | Not required (regenerate on demand) |
| User messages (chat history) | Keep forever in Message table | Manual `cp prisma/dev.db prisma/dev.db.bak` before demo |
| Embeddings | Recompute if transactions change (async job) | Not required (regenerable) |

---

## 6. System Constraints

### 6.1 Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Single process (monolith), not microservices | 1 dev, 1 day. Microservices add infrastructure complexity. Upgrade path in §19 (Aspirational Architecture). |
| SQLite (not Postgres) | Zero-config file-based DB. Easily shipped in repo. Scales to millions of txs; 128 is trivial. Upgradable to Postgres later. |
| Next.js 14 App Router (not Pages Router) | Newer standard; Server Components reduce client JS; API Routes colocated with pages. |
| Groq API (not OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) | Free tier, 30 req/min limit, 128k context, good reasoning quality for financial chatbot. Contingency: fallback to Llama 3.1 8B Instant for cheaper intent routing. |
| Transformers.js (not Cohere, Voyage, etc.) | Local embeddings, no API key, 384 dims sufficient for transaction search, runs in Node. Transformers model (~25 MB) downloaded on first use. |
| In-memory cosine (not pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate) | MVP scale (128 txs, 384 dims = ~200 KB). No external vector DB setup. Path to pgvector in Postgres later. |
| EWMA + linear trend (not Prophet, LSTM, TFT) | Only 3 monthly data points. Deep learning overfits. EWMA + trend is statistically appropriate and explainable. 12+ months data → upgrade to Prophet. |

### 6.2 Organizational Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|---|---|
| 1 developer, 1 day | Semester project, finite time budget. Scope strictly limited to MVP. Post-semester roadmap in doc for aspirational architecture. |
| Demo target: viva committee | 5-minute demo script; emphasis on chatbot intelligence + hallucination prevention (not deployment, scaling, mobile). |
| Pakistani context | Merchant names, currency (PKR), family support norms, salary cycles (1st of month), Islamic finance sensibilities (avoid recommending high-interest products without halal alternative). |
| Hardcoded single user (userId=1) | MVP for viva. Auth scaffolded but not wired. Multi-user upgrade path clear in schema (all tables have userId FK). |

### 6.3 Deployment Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Local dev runs on `http://localhost:3000` | Easiest for viva demo (no network latency, deterministic). No cloud deploy required. Optional: push to Vercel free tier for redundancy. |
| `.env.local` holds API key | Never committed. User must paste fresh Groq key from https://console.groq.com/keys. One-time setup. |
| SQLite file-based (`prisma/dev.db`) | On disk, persists across server restarts. Ignored in `.gitignore`. Not synced to cloud. Backup before demo if paranoid. |
| Transformers model cached in `.cache/` | Downloaded (~25 MB) on first embed call. Ignored in `.gitignore`. Subsequent calls load from disk. |

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### 7.1 Core Feature Acceptance

| Feature | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|
| Overview Page | All 4 KPI cards load with correct values; charts render with real data; "Ask FinPal" CTA works |
| Transactions Page | ≥128 transactions displayed; pagination works; category filter works; sorting by date works |
| Forecast Page | Next-month bar chart renders with ±1σ bands; affordability simulator works ("can afford" / "wait X months" answers are correct); savings rec card shows 20% target |
| Chat Page | Message input sends; assistant response streams token-by-token; tool calls are visible in trace panel; 6 sample-question chips work; error on bad API key shows graceful message |
| Tools (all 11) | Each tool runs without error; returns correct JSON shape; tool results match hand-calculated examples for seed data |
| Validator | Regex extracts PKR figures; verifies against tool results; flags mismatches (if any); passes for 100% of correct LLM outputs |
| RAG | `retrieveSimilarTransactions("Daraz")` returns the Daraz anomaly as top-1; `retrieveSimilarTransactions("food")` returns food delivery txs in top-5 |
| Forecast Math | Blend = 0.6×EWMA + 0.4×(EWMA+trend); matches hand calc for groceries (m1=14k, m2=15k, m3=16k) → blend ≈ 15,600 |
| Risk Score | Score ∈ [0,100]; band matches score; all 5 components sum correctly; breakdown explains final score |
| Affordability | `canAfford(price=50k, monthsAhead=0)` returns False with shortfall showing (savings < price - buffer). `canAfford(price=50k, monthsAhead=12)` projects savings correctly. |
| Installment Safety | `safety(price=320k, months=6, apr=0.0)` returns monthly ≈ 53,333, ratio ≈ 0.9 (unsafe given 30% threshold). Reason explains why. |
| Data Seeding | `npx tsx scripts/seed.ts` completes. Asserts total ∈ [200k, 300k] PKR. 14 categories present. At least one anomaly (z-score >3) visible. |
| Embeddings | `npx tsx scripts/embed_all.ts` completes. All 128 txs have embedding in DB. Model downloads on first run. |
| Database | `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` creates schema. Seed runs without errors. Indices present on (userId, date) and (userId, categoryId). |

### 7.2 Non-Functional Acceptance

| NFR | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|
| Page Load | Overview, Transactions, Forecast: <1.5s (Lighthouse), tested on dev server with throttling |
| Chat Latency | First token: <2s. Subsequent tokens: visible streaming (spacing <100ms between tokens). ✓ if user sees real-time text flow. |
| Tool Speed | All tools complete <500ms (90th percentile). Measured via server logs timestamp. |
| Bundle Size | Client JS + CSS: <300KB gzipped. Verify via `next build` output. |
| TypeScript | `npx tsc --noEmit` with zero errors. No @ts-ignore outside comments. |
| Security | `.env.local` not committed; `.env` in .gitignore. No API key in logs. Zod validation on all forms. Output validator catches fabricated numbers. |
| Documentation | README.md exists with setup, demo script, architecture. Architecture doc (§19 aspirational) linked. Code comments for non-obvious logic (EWMA formula, risk weighting, etc.). |

### 7.3 Viva Demonstration Acceptance

| Scenario | Success Criteria |
|---|---|
| 5-min demo script | "What category am I overspending in?" → tools show, answer cites categories, ✓ correct. "Can I afford iPhone in 6 months?" → affordability tool result shows, answer matches. "Find Daraz purchase" → RAG retrieves it, LLM cites merchant + date + amount. "How risky am I?" → risk score + breakdown shown, answer is coherent. All tool calls visible in trace panel. |
| Chatbot Integrity Question | "Explain hallucination prevention" → Answer cites: (1) system prompt rule (every number from tools), (2) Live Context Block, (3) tool-only numbers, (4) output validator. Viva committee nods. |
| Architecture Defensibility | "Why EWMA + trend, not Prophet?" → "3 monthly observations; Prophet needs 12+ months; EWMA + trend is statistically appropriate and explainable." "Why monolith?" → "1 dev, 1 day, viva quality. §19 shows microservice design for production." Committee satisfied. |
| Data Realism | "Is synthetic data realistic?" → Merchant names are authentic (Foodpanda, K-Electric, Imtiaz), day-of-week patterns present (weekend Cheezious spikes), salary cycle on 1st, one missed savings transfer, two anomalies visible. "Looks real." |
| Error Gracefully Handled | If Groq times out during demo → "Chat temporarily unavailable. Try again." User doesn't see 503 or stack trace. Retry works. |

---

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Unit Tests

| Module | Test Cases | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `finance/rules.ts` | Risk score: seed data → expect band "moderate"; zero savings → band "high"; zero spend → band "low" | Test riskScore(mockContext) |
| `finance/rules.ts` | Affordability: price < available → canAfford=true; price > (savings - buffer) → canAfford=false; future months project savings correctly | Test affordability(50000, 0) vs affordability(50000, 6) |
| `finance/rules.ts` | Installment: EMI calc correct for price=320k, months=6, apr=0.0 → monthly ≈ 53,333 | Test installmentSafety(320000, 6, 0) |
| `forecast/engine.ts` | EWMA + trend: m1=10k, m2=12k, m3=14k → EWMA=13k, trend=2k → blend=13.2k ±1.5k | Test forecastEngine.blend([10, 12, 14]) |
| `rag/embed.ts` | Embed deterministic: same text twice → same Float32Array (or very close) | Test embed("Foodpanda Cheezious") twice |
| `rag/retrieve.ts` | Top-k: embed query, compute cosine, sort descending. Verify top-1 is highest score. | Test retrieve("Daraz big purchase", 5) |

### 8.2 Integration Tests

| Scenario | Steps | Pass Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Full chat flow | User → "Can I afford X?" → Chat route → tool called → affordability rule runs → LLM gets result → streams answer → validator checks PKR figures → response sent | Answer includes PKR figures from tool result; validator doesn't flag false positives |
| Seed + Dashboard | `npm run seed` → seed completes and asserts spend ∈ [200k, 300k] → GET `/` loads Overview → KPI cards show non-zero values → charts render | Dashboard shows data; no empty states |
| RAG full loop | Seed runs → `npm run embed_all` completes → chat asks fuzzy question → RAG retrieves → top-1 result is semantically relevant | Top result passes human eyeball test |

### 8.3 Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start dev server: `npm run dev` → no console errors
- [ ] Page loads: `localhost:3000` → Overview renders <1.5s
- [ ] Seed data visible: KPI cards show PKR figures, charts have bars
- [ ] Category filter works: click "Groceries" chip → table filters
- [ ] Forecast page: chart shows 3 historical + 1 projected bar; error bands visible
- [ ] Affordability simulator: enter "iPhone", 380000, 6 months → "wait 14 months" answer (or similar)
- [ ] Chat: type "Can I afford an iPhone in 6 months?" → response streams → tool trace visible → numbers match affordability rule output
- [ ] RAG: type "Find the big purchase I made on Daraz" → retrieves Daraz txn → LLM cites merchant + amount
- [ ] Tool all 11 tools: manually check each tool in tool list returns non-error result (chat may not call all in single turn; call via curl if needed)
- [ ] Validator: check that no fabricated PKR figures appear in responses
- [ ] Errors: simulate Groq outage (use bad API key) → chat shows graceful error
- [ ] Dark mode (if toggled): UI visually appealing; contrast OK
- [ ] Mobile (optional): reload on tablet, no crazy layout breaks

## 9. Appendices

### 9.1 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Live Context Block** | Injected system prompt section refreshed each chat turn with current user's balances, spending, risk score, anomalies, goals. Prevents hallucination by giving LLM authoritative facts. |
| **Tool Call** | Vercel AI SDK invocation of one of 11 deterministic financial functions. LLM decides which tools to call based on user question. |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation: embed user query + transaction descriptions, rank by cosine similarity, return top-k as context for LLM answer. |
| **EWMA** | Exponential Weighted Moving Average: time-series smoother with decay factor α. Lower α = more historical weight; higher α = more recent weight. |
| **EMI** | Equated Monthly Installment: fixed monthly payment for a loan. Calculated from principal, tenure, interest rate. |
| **Seed** | Initialization of database with synthetic data. One-time step on first setup. |
| **Hardcoded User** | userId=1 constant used throughout MVP. No auth; single-user assumption. |
| **Validator** | Output guardrail: extracts PKR figures from LLM response, verifies against tool results, flags mismatches. |

### 9.4 Demo Script (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Duration: 5 minutes. Evaluator: Viva Committee.**

```
1. OVERVIEW (30 sec)
   - Open localhost:3000 (already running on background)
   - Point to 4 KPI cards: "Here's the user's financial snapshot — 
     liquid balance, this month's spending with projection, savings rate, risk score."
   - Gesture to charts: "3 months of realistic Pakistani spending: 
     income, expenses, savings trend (green trend upward = good). 
     Category breakdown shows groceries dominant."
   - Mention: "This is synthetic data, PKR 240k total over 3 months, 
     very realistic — salary on the 1st, weekly groceries, daily food delivery, etc."

2. FORECAST (30 sec)
   - Click Forecast tab.
   - Show chart: "Next month, we project PKR X ± Y per category. 
     This uses EWMA + linear trend on the 3-month history — 
     statistically sound given only 3 data points."
   - Open Affordability Simulator: "Say the user wants an iPhone for PKR 380k. 
     When can they afford it?" Type 380000, 6 months, press Calculate.
   - Read result aloud: "Not yet, short by PKR Y. At current savings rate, 
     about 14 months." Pause. "This is deterministic: it's the affordability 
     rule doing the math, not guessing."

3. CHAT (3 min)
   - Click Chat tab.
   - Type: "What category am I overspending in?" [Send]
     Watch stream arrive. Tool trace shows: getCategoryBreakdown() + getRiskScore().
     Answer cites categories with numbers. Expand tool trace: "You can see the 
     actual function calls — this chatbot never makes up numbers."
   
   - Type: "Can I afford an iPhone in 6 months?" [Send]
     Tool trace: runAffordability() with monthsAhead=6, price=380000.
     Answer matches the rule's output: "Not yet, wait 14 months."
   
   - Type: "Should I save first or buy on installments?" [Send]
     Tools: runInstallmentSafety() + runAffordability(). 
     Answer explains both paths with exact PKR numbers from the rules.
   
   - Type: "Find the big purchase I made on Daraz." [Send]
     Tool: retrieveSimilarTransactions(). Top result is the Daraz anomaly (8k case). 
     LLM cites: "You made a purchase at Daraz on [date] for PKR 14,800. 
     That's unusual — 3× your typical online shopping amount."
   
   - Type: "How risky is my spending?" [Send]
     Tool: getRiskScore(). Breakdown shows 5 components: spend-to-income ratio, 
     volatility, savings rate, high-risk categories, anomalies. 
     Answer: "Moderate risk (41/100) — volatility is the main concern, 
     with some discretionary overspend."

4. WRAP (30 sec)
   - "The core insight: every number the chatbot cites comes from tools 
     that operate on real data. No hallucination. The system validates 
     every PKR figure before it reaches the user.
     
     We use 4 layers: (1) system prompt rule, (2) Live Context Block 
     injected each turn with current balances + risk, (3) tool-only numbers, 
     (4) output validator regex. If the LLM tries to invent a number, 
     it gets caught and stripped.
     
     Architecture is production-inspired even though it's 1 day to build: 
     Next.js monolith, SQLite, Groq API, local embeddings via Transformers.js. 
     We chose simple over deep — EWMA forecast instead of Prophet, 
     in-memory cosine RAG instead of external vector DB. 
     That's honest given the small scale."
   
   - "Questions?"

### 9.5 Known Limitations & Future Work

**Known Limitations (MVP):**
- Single hardcoded user (userId=1); no multi-user auth
- Forecast uses only 3 monthly observations (EWMA + trend); no seasonality
- RAG is in-memory cosine; no reranker, no hybrid BM25+dense
- No real bank-statement import (data is synthetic)
- No notifications, PDF exports, voice interface
- Groq free tier has 30 req/min rate limit

**Future Enhancements (Post-Semester):**
- Multi-user with NextAuth + Postgres + RLS (Row-Level Security)
- Real CSV import (HBL, Meezan, JazzCash bank exports)
- Upgrade to Prophet (when ≥12 months data exist)
- Hybrid retrieval with BM25 + pgvector + reranker
- Goal-driven nudges via push notifications
- Microservice split: NLP service, ML service, Auth service
- Observability: OpenTelemetry → Grafana + Loki
- LLM provider router: fallback from Groq to Claude if Groq slow/down

- [x] API endpoints (6 routes, all functional)
- [x] Frontend pages (4 pages: Overview, Transactions, Forecast, Chat)
- [x] Chatbot with 11 tools (all functional, tested with seed data)
- [x] RAG system (embeddings, in-memory retrieval, tested with Daraz anomaly)
- [x] Rule engine (risk, affordability, installment, forecast, all deterministic)
- [x] Hallucination validator (regex, checks PKR figures against sources)
- [x] README.md with setup + demo script
- [x] Architecture document (§19, production-scale aspirational design)
- [x] This SRS document

**Next Steps:**
1. User replaces `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env.local` with fresh key from https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Run `npm run dev` to start dev server
3. Execute demo script for viva committee
4. Optionally push to GitHub with fresh history (no API key leak)
5. Optional: deploy to Vercel free tier for cloud demo redundancy
